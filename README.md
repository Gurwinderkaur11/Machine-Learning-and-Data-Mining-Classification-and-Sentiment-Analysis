**Task 1: Classification Problem**
Dataset: Wine Quality Dataset
Source: UCI Repository
Features: 11 features including acidity, alcohol, pH, etc.
Target: Wine quality, represented as an integer value between 0 and 10.
Problem Overview:
In this task, we aim to predict the quality of wines based on their chemical properties. Using the Wine Quality dataset, the objective is to classify wines into different quality categories using machine learning models.

**Process:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Analyzed the distribution of features and their correlations using visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Handled missing values, scaled the features, and removed any outliers to ensure clean data for modeling.
Preprocessing:

Standardized the data using StandardScaler to bring all features to a similar scale.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Models Applied:

**Logistic Regression:** A simple linear model to estimate the probability of wine quality classes.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful model for high-dimensional data classification.
Random Forest Classifier: A robust ensemble method to capture complex patterns.
Decision Tree Classifier: A simple tree-based model for understanding the decision-making process.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the models based on accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 82%.
Key Insights:
The Random Forest model outperformed other models, demonstrating its strength in handling imbalanced datasets and capturing complex relationships between features.
This model can assist in optimizing wine production processes and improving quality control.



**Task 2: Clustering Problem**
Dataset:
Bike Sharing Dataset
Source: UCI Repository
Features: Features such as season, temperature, humidity, and hour of the day.
Target: The number of bike rentals (cnt), which we treat as a clustering problem.
Problem Overview:
In this task, we aim to uncover hidden patterns in the bike rental data by clustering different rental behaviors across various conditions. Using clustering techniques, the goal is to identify groups or patterns that could improve bike-sharing operations.

Process:
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Visualized key features like temperature, humidity, and wind speed to understand their relationship with bike rentals.
Handled missing values and normalized the features to ensure they are on a similar scale for clustering.
Clustering Algorithms Applied:

**K-Means Clustering:** A popular method for dividing data into distinct groups based on similarity.
Agglomerative Clustering: A hierarchical clustering method that builds a tree of clusters.
Evaluation Metrics:

Used the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index to assess the quality of the clusters formed by each algorithm.
Compared results from different clustering techniques to find the best approach for identifying rental patterns.
Results:

K-Means performed better based on the Silhouette Score, indicating more distinct and well-separated clusters.
The clustering revealed patterns in bike rentals across different seasons and times of day, helping to identify high-demand periods.
Key Insights:
The K-Means algorithm was able to effectively identify patterns in bike rental behavior.
These insights can help bike-sharing businesses optimize bike distribution and station placements, improving operational efficiency.


**Task 3: Sentiment Analysis**
Dataset:
**Sentiment140 Dataset**
Source: Sentiment140
Features: Twitter data containing 1.6 million tweets, labeled as either positive or negative sentiment.
Target: Sentiment (positive/negative).
Problem Overview:
This task focuses on classifying the sentiment of tweets as positive or negative. The goal is to develop a model that can analyze text data and predict the sentiment behind tweets, providing valuable insights into public opinion on various topics.

**Process:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Visualized the most frequent words in the dataset using a word cloud.
Cleaned and preprocessed the text data by removing stop words and applying stemming to standardize the text.
Text Preprocessing:

Tokenized the text data into individual words and transformed the text into numerical features using CountVectorizer, which converts words into a vector of word counts.
Sentiment Analysis Models Applied:

**Logistic Regression**
**Naive Bayes Classifier**
**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
**Random Forest Classifier**
**Evaluation Metrics:**

Evaluated model performance using classification reports, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results:

Naive Bayes Classifier performed well with an accuracy of 84%, making it effective in classifying tweets as positive or negative based on their content.
The model demonstrated the ability to classify sentiment in real-time social media data.
Key Insights:
The Naive Bayes Classifier is a strong model for sentiment analysis on short text data like tweets.
Businesses and organizations can use sentiment analysis to monitor social media conversations, track brand perception, and make data-driven decisions.
